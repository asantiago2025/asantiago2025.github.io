                            <p>Next are K-dramas. It’s through these dramas and their impressionable stories that Filipinos are able to discover and appreciate all other aspects of Hallyu, from music, language, food, fashion, culture, sports, and even Korean tourism itself. With so many K-dramas presenting the beauty and promise of South Korea, the urge to fly to the Land of the Morning Calm to encounter its people and see famous filming locations for ourselves becomes even stronger.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the huge viewer demand has prompted Philippine television stations to import Korean dramas and films.</p>
                            <p>Top K-dramas, such as Boys Over Flowers, The Heirs, What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo, Train to Busan, and Romantic Doctor Teacher Kim are imported and dubbed in Filipino, capturing the attention of many audiences through high ratings.</p>
                            <p>The relatable plotlines of such appeal to the hearts of many Filipinos aside from the good looks and acting of the Korean actors and actresses. Adaptations of popular Koreanovelas and movies can also be seen once in a while.</p>
                            <p>The Filipino adaptations of the award-winning "My Love from the Star" and “Descendants of the Sun” have previously garnered mixed reactions from fans.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, the remake of “Miracle in Cell No. 7” at the 2019 Metro Manila Film Festival was loved by many fans.</p>
